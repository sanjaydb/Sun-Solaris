The safest approach is to order an extra disk. Since virtually all production systems mirror their disks,
this means ordering 3 disks. One disk is for the root (/) file system, a second is for the mirror of the
root file system, and the third is for Oracle Solaris Live Upgrade

# lucreate --> to create the copy
# luupgrade -->  to upgrade the OS on the copy
# luactivate -->  to choose the environment to boot


# cd /var/tmp/lupatches
 Then add each patch individually:
# patchadd <patch_id>
# init 6
 
 Incase of CD-rom
 ----------------
sparc
# cd /cdrom/cdrom0/s0/Solaris_10/Tools/Installers
# ./liveupgrade20 -noconsole -nodisplay
 
x86
# cd /cdrom/cdrom0/Solaris_10/Tools/Installers
# ./liveupgrade20 -noconsole -nodisplay

# lucreate -c s10Mar05 -n s10Jan06 -m /:c0t1d0s0:ufs
 
<sparc> # luupgrade -u -n s10Jan06 -s /cdrom/cdrom0/s0
<x86> # luupgrade -u -n s10Jan06 -s /cdrom/cdrom0

# luactivate s10Jan06
 # init 6
 
 
 
: Patching a System Using Oracle Solaris Live Upgrade 
------------------------------------------------------
10. # cd /var/tmp/10_Recommended 
# luupgrade -n s10Jan06 -s /var/tmp/10_Recommended -t `cat patch_order`
Note the argument to the -t option is placed in backquotes meaning the expression
will be evaluated by the shell before sending the results (the list of patches) to the luupgrade
command.
