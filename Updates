How to Configure the Oracle Solaris support Repository
{
  Log into the following site.
  http://pkg-register.oracle.com/

  Download the SSL key and certificate for the Oracle Solaris 11 release.
  Consider creating a directory inside /var/pkg to store the key and certificate.
  # mkdir -m 0755 -p /var/pkg/ssl
  # cp -i Oracle_Solaris_11_Support.key.pem /var/pkg/ssl
  # cp -i Oracle_Solaris_11_Support.certificate.pem /var/pkg/ssl

  Copy the key and certificate from the directory that you downloaded the key and certificate into this directory.
  The key files are kept by reference, so if the files become inaccessible to the packaging system, you will encounter errors.

  Set the publisher to the support repository.
  # pkg set-publisher \
            -k /var/pkg/ssl/Oracle_Solaris_11_Support.key.pem \
            -c /var/pkg/ssl/Oracle_Solaris_11_Support.certificate.pem \
            -O https://pkg.oracle.com/solaris/support solaris

  Install the updated packages from the support repository, if desired.
  # pkg update



}
